                      <p>
                        The E.T.R Model X2-9A was designed by X5 under the
                        Akkadia Defense and Research Unity Program with the goal
                        to secure stellar distance communications. The device
                        used Quantum entanglement stability and accuracy. THE
                        X2-9A HAS THE CAPACITY OF 5 DIMENSIONAL ENTANGLEMENT AND
                        THE ABILITY TO ACCESS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE
                        HUMAN NEURAL CORTEX. IT CAN DISRUPT, MANIPULATE OR
                        INFLUENCE MOST UNITY SENTIENTS. FOR THIS REASON THE
                        X5-9A BEEN BANNED FROM ALL FEDERATION OPERATIONS. ANY
                        AND ALL CITIZENS IN POSSESSION OF A ETR X2-9A WILL BE
                        TERMINATED ON SIGHT. ALL X2-9A UNITS HAVE BEEN
                        DECOMMISSIONED AND USED FOR ITS RARE COMPONENTS AS
                        ENERGY RESOURCES.
